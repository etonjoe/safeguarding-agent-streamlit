# Safeguarding Support Agent (Streamlit + Gemini)

This application provides an AI-powered interface to query a school's safeguarding policy document using Google's Gemini model with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

**Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for informational support and does *not* replace professional judgment, mandatory training, or required reporting procedures. Always consult with your Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL) for definitive guidance and follow established protocols.

## Features

* **Policy Q&A:** Ask questions in natural language about the safeguarding policy.
* **RAG Implementation:** Retrieves relevant sections from the policy PDF to ground the AI's answers.
* **Conversational Memory:** Remembers the context of the current chat session.
* **Function Calling:** Simulates actions like escalating to the DSL based on policy triggers identified by the AI.
* **Streamlit UI:** Easy-to-use web interface.
